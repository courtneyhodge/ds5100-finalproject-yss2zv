    "\n",
    "For your Final Project, you will write, test, use, package, and publish\n",
    "a Python module and accompanying files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module will implement a simple [Monte Carlo\n",
    "simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) using a set\n",
    "of three related classes — a Die class, a Game class, and an Analyzer\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes are related in the following way: Game objects are\n",
    "initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with\n",
    "a Game object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Die\\] &rarr; \\[Game\\] &rarr; \\[Analyzer\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulator, a “die” can be any discrete random variable\n",
    "associated with a stochastic process, such as using a deck of cards,\n",
    "flipping a coin, rolling an actual die, or speaking a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to integrate what you have learned in this class\n",
    "by calling upon the following areas of knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Basic syntax, expressions, and statements in Python.\n",
    "-   Python Classes with initialization methods.\n",
    "-   Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "-   Literate programming with docstrings and documentation.\n",
    "-   Unit testing with Unittest.\n",
    "-   Simple plotting with Pandas.\n",
    "-   Program modularization and packaging with Setuptools.\n",
    "-   GitHub for managing and sharing code."

    "\n",
    "-   A die has $N$ sides, or “faces”, and $W$ weights, and can be rolled\n",
    "    to select a face.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For example, a “die” with $N = 2$ is a coin, and a one with\n",
    "        $N = 6$ is a standard die.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Normally, dice and coins are “fair,” meaning that the each side\n",
    "        has an equal weight. An unfair die is one where the weights are\n",
    "        unequal.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each side contains a unique symbol. Symbols may be all alphabetic or\n",
    "    all numeric.\n",

    "-   The weights are just positive numbers (integers or floats, including $0$), not a normalized probability\n",
    "    distribution.\n",
